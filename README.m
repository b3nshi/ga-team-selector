# Quick example of GA using Octave

## Requirements

* Octave (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)

## Description

I wrote this simple code, and perhaps not the best one when using Octave, since I haven't written
code using Matlab or Octave in a while, but the intention was to review the concepts and explain
the findings in this [Blog Article](https://klivr.com/?p=1768).

The algorithm searches for the best teams to play a game based on the players score. It can be
configured to different amount of players, and of course it should be improved, but for the purpose
of the article is good enought to leave it as-is, since as I mention in the article, the goal is
to continue developing it in JS.
